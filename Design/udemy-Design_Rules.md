# udemy / Design Rules





the closer the UI is to what the user expects, the better usually the UX is, too (implementation model - represented model - mental model)

as a user you don't care how sth works - the focus is on experience

##every force evolves form

###form shoud be determined by SUCCESS CRITERIA - not by function or personal aesthetic preferences

because you're interested in **outcomes**, not features (people don't use things always for what they were designed for)

#### questions

- What aspects of the design (features, functions and form) are **critical** to success?
- When time and resources are limited, what design tradeoffs would *least harm* the design's success?
  Meaning that BOTH aesthetics and functionality may have to be compromised
- what visually communicates value?

#### function is only a single, isolated aspect of what drives & influences form

### what drives form? (forces)

- audience needs
- client desires
- ethical obligations
- aesthetic inclinations
- technology constraints/ limitations
- cultural suppositions
- functional requirements
- material properties (screen size, etc.)
- available time
- available budget
- available resources

## small screens

- icons without labels are worse than labels alone
- when an opportunity to interact isn't *visible*, people asume it isn't *available*

### five rules for effective UI design on screens



1. ####focus on context of use
	when are people using the site/app? 
	when they're stressed/bored/busy/lost?
	
	
	
2. #### simplify
   each screen should contain one primary action
   
   each screen should provide sth **usefull, meaningful and valuable** (makes product easier to use)
   

-> **the number of screens doesn't matter**

   

3. #### design for thumbs
   vast majority of people rely on one or both thumbs to interact with their phones
   

place **menu items, frequently used controls** and **common actions** within easy thumb reach

   

4. #### Design for fat fingers
   controls and tap targets should be a minimum of 9mm (48px) in diameter
   

provide ample space between targets to accidental tapping doesn't occ

   

5. #### Minimize the need for typing
   it's a slow process almost always filled with errors â€“ so the less it's needed the better
   
   keep forms short and simple
   
   use auto-complet and personalized data wherever possible

## Organizing visual Information

### 1. Balance (between elements. neg. + white space) creates visual order & signals relationships

2. rhythm
   rhythm occurs when the interval between elements is predictable -nvisual rhythm speeds comprehension
3. harmony is visual echo
4. dominance
   not a matter of size, but of appearance, placement, contrast, negative space
5. use dominance to create flow
   dominance directs user focus
6. alignment
   align everything with everything else
7. proximity 
   ...is used to signal relationships between elements
   ... often beats color and contrast



---------------------------

## COLOR

- it stirs an emotional response
- color needs to be used consistently
- the right colors draw the eye to the most important areas on the screen
- color can maximize readability and minimize optical fatigue
- **interaaction cues** can be shown by color
- should HIGHLIGHt, not determine -> it should never be the sole differentiator of things in the UI
- bright saturated colours should only be used as visual accents

#### start with one dominant neutral color, then add an accent color

### color theory - are you using color correctly?

- are colors used sparingly?
- do your colors reinforce or interfere with hierarchy and content?
- is the color scheme used consistently (interactive elements, state changes, buttons consistent on all screens?)
- is color functional, or just decorative? 
  (should enhance understanding, impart meaning, provide guidance)
- does functionality depend on color? 
  (should be just as functional for colourblind people)

#### use color to communicate + influence interaction

### how to chose the right colors

**BLACK**
authority, power, timeless, coll, brooding, counter culture

**WHITE**
innocence, purity, cleanliness, sterility, surrender, peace

**RED**
alarm, urgency, attention, intensity, speed, warning, love
been proven to increase blood circulation, breathing and metabolism
signifies importance and priority

**PINK**
romance, gratitude, grace, admiration, harmony, compassion, female

**BLUE**
peaceful, tranquil, sky, ocean, business, tech, innovation, male
calming & inviting

**GREEN**
neture, organic, calming, refreshing, relaxing
success, growth, money, well balanced

**YELLOW**
optimism, happiness, warmth, positivity, joy, hope

**PURPLE**
royalty, wealth, luxury, sophistication, famale, romantic

**BROWN**
nature, earth, home, friendship, richness, genuinness, solidity

### choose colors from around you

four color variants needed for good UI design:

- Shadow
- Midtone
- Highlight
- Accent

 can be chosen from brand colors,  images, objects, etc.

when choosing from existing colors: try to be aware of saturation; decrease if needed

**choose color based on associations, emotions and brand**

###Contrast directs focus

- enables readability (unless too high or too low)
- areas of high contrast draw the user's attention first
- should be applied according to the importance of a particular element
- **primary content** or **actions** should have the most contrast; secondary content and actions should have lower contrast by degrees
- contrast helps the user understand relationships between onscreen elements

#### contrast always wins

### Context - color and contrast depend on it

color and contrast should clearly indicate **what** and **where** the call to action is located

----------------------



## Typography



- 95% of what we see onscreen is text-based language
- typography has one plain duty: convey information; a product which cannot be read becomes a product without purpose
- creates emotional impact
- appropiate typographic choices create:
  - Readability, Accessibility, Usability, Visual balance
- 

### 7 rules for Great Typography

1. **Two typefaces maximum**

   no more than 2 font families

   character width and weights of each font should be complementary to the other (kerning is similar)

   pairings need to have visual difference

2. **Limit Line Width**

   when lines are too long, the eye has to work harder to track the text, makes reading and comprehension slower

   common standard is 60 characters / line

   mobile devices: 30-40 characters per line

3. **Choose Readability over everything else**

   typfaces need to stay readable at all their different sizes used in your UI

   they also need to stay legible on different devices with different screen sizes and resolutions

4. **Choose legibility**

   make sure letterforms are clearly distinguishable in your typeface

   chose typafecs with good kerning

5. **Use good leading**

   breaks between paragraphs give the eye a place to rest

   leading shoul dbe equal to at least HALF the character height
   
6. **align text elements in a layout using their baseline**

  when you have multiple text elements on a single screen, they should share points of common alignment
  
7. **Use styles to visually differentiate content**
  
  choose a typeface with at least 3 styles: **regular, italic, bold**
  
  this can remove the need for another font entirely 
  
  every level of information can be signified with styling
  
    

### 5 Rules for choosing Imagery

1. **make sure it serves a purpose**
   what message will it send?

2. **focus on people, not things**
   you want people to see themselves in what you're promoting

   images of people looking away make it easier for the viewers to imagine they are that person

3. **Cropping can change meaning**

4. **Never go for the cheap shot**
   especially if it's sexist or demeaning

5. **don't forget the power of illustration**
   illustrations can be more impactful than fotography

   if the subject is something we see a lot, you can become numb to it

   illustration can be more relevent - provide emotional support to editorials

####imagery Do's and Don'ts

DO show an actual person when the reference to that person is specific

DO use illustration when specificity isn't possible, or doesn't apply

DO look for images that represent and tell realistic stories
DON'T use posed, stages stock images that feel faked and unemotional

DO if you're referencing a specific product, show that specific product (even screenshots of the interface/how your tool works)
DON'T default to generic, literal stock photos

DO use color composition to create a focal point that communicates meaning
DON'T make the user hunt for the hidden meaning(s) in your image

DO use images with only a few meaningful elements, with minimal distractions
DON'T obscure the point of focus, which also obscures meaning and diminishes power

DO strive for clear visual focus, which communicates the concept at a glance
DON'T use photos whose lalck of focus makes the image meaningless

DO buikd a narrative, imply an interesting, informative story
DON'T use images without context; they don't convey mood, brand, and context

DO show a product and people in the context of a real-world situation
DON'T show a product and its user disassociated from that context; it's not interesting

##Creating and Simplifying Visual Cues

###Icons

- make excellent touch targets
- icons save space
- are quick to recognized (if used/seen before)
- should clearly convey meaning
- app/website/software icons should be base on **commonly** used device/plattform/system icons
- if you spend more than **15 minutes** trying ot choose an icon to represent something... an icon (without a label) will probably not work in that instance
- **labels** clarify both meaning and functionality
- **label + icon** is hard to beat

#### Four core types:

**SIMILAR** Icons are useful for simple, easily understood actions and concepts

**SYMBOLIC** icons represent an action, object, or concept at high abstraction

**EXAMPLE** icons use images of things that exemplify or are commonly associated with an action, object, or concept

**ARBITRARY** icons bear no resemblance to the represented concept; their maning is learned through repeated exposure

###Five Rules for Effective Icon Design

1. keep visual/perceived size consistent
2. h
3. h
4. h
5. h

### Simplifying Visual Cues

- remove backgrounds
- remove redundant labels
- remove unnecessary borders and containers
- reduce colors: highlight most important data
- remove all effects (#D, shadows...)
- visually separate labels/lines from data
- remove extraneous lines and labels



###Separating Content from Controls 

- **when there are too many choices, it's easier for people to choose** *nothing*.
- **when everything is interactive, nothing is**
- **separate content from controls** (interactive elements should be distinct from their content counterparts; text vs. buttons)
- **separte primary + secondary (+ tertiary... ) actions**
  economy, clarity and focus is created by differentiating primary actions
  e.g.: **SAVE** button (primary) has higher contrast than **Cancel** (secondary) button
