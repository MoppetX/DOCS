# Design is a job



A designer requires honest feedback and real criticism, and that’s not going to happen in a realm where colleagues or clients are worried about crushing the spirit of a magical being. The sparkly fog of affirmation gets in the way.

any design task you undertake must serve a goal. It’s your job to find out what those goals are.

1. “Why are we doing this?”
   If the answer isn’t clear, or isn’t clear to you, or just doesn’t exist, you can’t design anything.
2. Who are we designing for? How will they use what we are designing? Do they need it? What backend technologies does the client have at their disposal? What new ones are they open to trying? Who else has tried this and how have they succeeded or failed?
   Once you have design goals you need to gather as much information as possible to make sure you are designing a solution that will fulfill those goals.
3. A designer imposes order
4. A designer creates novel forms
5. No matter how good the work is, if you can’t sell it you haven’t finished the job.

Your toolbox should contain tools for input (goals and research), activity (make things!), and output (sell those things!).



###Maintain relationships

The end of a project is not the end of the client relationship. First, you have a responsibility to check in on the success of the work. Were the longer-term goals met? Did the metrics meet everyone’s expectations? Second, maintaining relationships is the single most important thing you can do to ensure good referrals.

Send the occasional email, or make the occasional phone call, to just say hello. Check in briefly. If their company just did something awesome send them an email, mention it on Twitter, and congratulate them publicly. Maybe once in a blue moon make plans for a drink or a meal.

# CLIENT SCREENER

What is the primary business and structure of your business/organization?

Summarize the project

Is this a redesign of something that exists or designing something new?

What are your major goals for this project?

Where do you see us adding the most value/complementing your existing team?

Who will be working on this project from your end? Will any additional outside partners or agencies be involved and how?

What is motivating you or enabling you to do this project now?

When does our work need to be finished? What is your target total completion date? What is driving that?

What is most important about this project? 

How important is each of these?

- Change in company strategy
- Rebranding/New image/Look and feel
- Engineering/Backend development
- Improving key metrics/Quantifying success or results/Conversion
- Content strategy/writing
- Understanding your audience or organization
- Getting it done as fast as possible
- Getting it done as inexpensively as possible
- Differentiating from competition
- Reach new audience
- Better demonstrate value or correct misconceptions
- Working relationship/communication with your design partner
- Who is/are your audience/your target users/your customers?

What does success look like? How will you know this project has succeeded?

What are you worried about? What do you imagine going wrong?

Is there anything about your organization that might make this project easier or harder in any specific ways?

What is your budget range?

What does the selection process look like on your end? How many people are you talking to and when do you expect to be making a decision?

-------------------

So even when you choose not to work with someone you want to leave them with a good impression. If you give them a clear, positive idea of what you do, they will then refer you to others.

### Request for proposals (RFPs)

The key to handling an RFP is to find out who wrote it. Most come with a contact number in case you have questions. Call it. Make friends with the people who wrote it. They may have even heard of you. If so, you’re golden. Strike up a conversation with them and get as much detail as you can about the organization involved.

The other problem with RFPs is that they can be overly prescriptive in nature. They can include specific solutions that may or may not be appropriate. This is usually an indication that the organization is freaked out about having to hire designers and is trying to maintain as much control as possible. It’s a cry for help and your opportunity to create mutual understanding. Speaking directly to a designer may be what they need, much more than getting 325 replies to a badly-formed RFP.

### Outbound contact

go after clients you want to work for. Let’s just be realistic about the return on this type of business development. It is very, very low.



------------------------



## Choosing Clients

The clients you choose to take on define you. Your portfolio needs to tell a story and each client you add to it is another chapter in that story. Make sure you’re consciously building the story you want to be telling. And make sure your story is compelling enough that your next client is excited to become a character in it.

Over the years the one constant that we’ve been able to rely on is that how a potential client behaves in the business development process is exactly how they will behave during the project. Trust your gut. If they’re slow to return your calls now, while they’re trying to engage you, they’ll be just as slow later. If gathering requirements or technical constraints is hard, then gathering feedback will be just as hard, if not harder.

Beware of clients who have waited to call you until they have a perfect diagram of what they need and want you to color it in. If they’re not coming to you for strategy and problemsolving, they’re not coming to you for design, they’re coming to you for production. And if you take on production work, you don’t get to call yourself a designer.

###Reluctant buyers

Never work with someone who shows up begrudgingly and doesn’t understand the value of design. It’s not going to work out. If someone doesn’t understand the value of what you do they’re going to be reluctant to both pay the price and do the work to get it done right.

###Your role in making clients better

The truth is that no one is born knowing how to be a good client, just as no one is born knowing how to be a good designer. And look how hard you have to work at being a good designer!

By and large, most clients want to be good clients, and they’re trying to do the right thing by their business.

-------------------



## Charging For Your Work

So how much should you charge? You charge as much as you can. If you can stand in front of a client completely confident and explain why you are worth the amount you quoted, you should charge it.

Undercharging for your work has the same effect. You’re telling your client the work has little value. Clients value you in direct proportion to how much it costs them. **No one is going to value your work, or your time, if you don’t.**

There is always someone cheaper. Negotiate price, but don’t compete on price. Compete on quality, value, and fit.

### Charge for value, not time

You should, of course, know the minimum rate you need to make to keep the lights on. But you should be charging clients based on what that work is worth to them, not the time it takes you to complete it.

### Nothing in your proposal should be a surprise

Start with a high-level draft and iterate quickly, with the client offering insight into anything that may trip up their team and pointing out potential roadblocks. The frank and open communication you begin here will serve you well throughout the project. You need to expose all implicit assumptions because the road to feeling ripped off is paved with assumptions about what you were getting.

Here is a short list of terrible surprises to avoid, just to give you an idea:

- Copywriting
- Backend development
- Localization
- Video production and motion graphics
- Custom illustration
- Content migration
- Print collateral
- CMS customization
- SEO
- Maintenance

Don’t ever leave a proposal on its own. A proposal is a prop for a sales presentation. If at all possible, get yourself in front of the client’s decision-makers and sell. Make sure you go over key benefits of the proposal. You don’t sell features, you build features. You sell benefits. You are convincing them to hire you, not accept your proposal. The proposal is merely one data point toward that decision. Your presentation skills will decide how big a data point it is.

###“Why is your bid higher than the others?”

I love it when a client asks this question. You will learn to love it as well. First off, congratulations on having the confidence to bid high but not too high! Second, your high bid did not scare off the client. Furthermore, you’re being presented with an excellent opportunity to further sell yourself. The client is asking you to close the deal.

You need to sound confident as hell that not only did you bid correctly, but that you are the best possible fit for this job. And by going into detail about how you got to that price, you can show them that you have a detailed understanding of what it will take to get that job done.

### Negotiation

If the client wants the price lowered, go over all the items in the proposal and find out what can be cut. Never lower the price without taking something away. And never take something away without explaining the lost benefit. If the lost benefit wasn’t that great then maybe it’s a fine thing to cut anyway. The amount isn’t arbitrary; every item has a set cost.

The secrets to getting the price you want for your work are having done the homework to know you’re asking for the right thing, the confidence to ask for it, and the willingness to walk away when you can’t get it.

## Stick to Your Process

###How you can assure your client things are going well

stay in good communication with your clients at all times. They will accept your process as long as you are showing them results. Make sure to set their expectations correctly as to what is happening when. And once they happen let them know you’re on track. Should they get off track make sure to communicate that as well. How you handle the communication of something going badly and how quickly you can implement a plan for getting back on track is ultimately more important than going off track to begin with.
