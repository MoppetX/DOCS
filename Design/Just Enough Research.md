# Just Enough Research 

Research is just another name for critical thinking. With a little encouragement, everyone on your team can open their minds and embrace it. And together, we can fix it so no one contemplating a web project ever mentions focus groups again

- ####Generative or exploratory research: “What’s up with...?”
  This is the research you do before you even know what you’re doing. It leads to ideas and helps define the problem. Don’t think of this as just the earliest research. Even if you’re working on anmexisting product or service, you might be looking for ideas for additional features or other enhancements, or new products you could bring to an audience you’re already serving.

- #### Descriptive and explanatory: “What and how?”

  Descriptive research involves observing and describing the characteristics of what you’re studying. This is what you do when you already have a design problem and you need to do your homework to fully understand the context to ensure that you design for the audience instead of yourself. You’ve moved past “What is a good problem to solve?” to “What is the best way to solve the problem I’ve identified?”

- #### Evaluative research: “Are we getting close?”

  Once you have a very clear idea of the problem you’re trying

  to solve, you can begin to define potential solutions. And once

  you have ideas for potential solutions, you can test them to

  make sure they work and meet the requirements you’ve identified.

- #### Causal research: “Why is this happening?”

  Once you have implemented the solutions you proposed, and

  have a website or application up and running out in the world,

  you might start noticing that people are using it in a certain way,

  possibly a way that isn’t exactly what you’d hoped. Or perhaps,

  something really terrific is happening and you want to replicate

  the success in other parts of your operation.
