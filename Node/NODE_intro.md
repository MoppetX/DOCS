# NODE

## Intro

 Working on these challenges will involve you writing your code on Glitch on our starter project. After completing each challenge you can copy your public Glitch url (to the homepage of your app) into the challenge screen to test it! Optionally you may choose to write your project on another platform but it must be publicly visible for our testing.



`package.json`
A file generated by npm when starting a new project. This file lists the package dependencies for your project.

- there are two  required fields: **"name"** and **"version"**
- all field names must use **double-quotes (")** and be separated with a **comma (,)**



`node_modules`
 a folder where npm saves packages. they can be installed two ways:

1. globally in a root `node_modules` folder, accessible by all projects.
2. locally within a project's own `node_modules` folder, accessible only to that project.
