# CSS

## troubleshooting





----------------

#### break out of parent boundaries for an element:

E.g.:   ```margin-left: -200px```



---------------------

#### hard-coded sizes:

if you have width or height of an element hard-coded, ALWAYS include 

```css
max-width: 100%
```

to make sure the element won't be bigger than it's parent
