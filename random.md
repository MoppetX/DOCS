#NPM troubleshooting



when there's weird hiccups: 

```bash
cd "root directory of project"
rm -rf node_modules
npm i
git st
npm start
```

> I do [thing] so that [people] can [do their thing]. 

Examples:

- I refactor HTML, CSS, and JS so front end devs can get something into the hands of stakeholders faster. 
- I code AI in Unity so that players feel like they have the right level of challenge for them.
